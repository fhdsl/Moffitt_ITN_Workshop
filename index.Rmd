To create a **Posit Cloud** account, go to the [Posit Cloud website](https://login.posit.cloud/register?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.login.posit.cloud%2Foauth%2Flogin%3Fshow_auth%3D0%26show_login%3D0) and sign up with any of the shown methods.

### Accessing Computational Resources for further practice or your research

- **Galaxy**: The training link will no longer work, and you should use [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/) to access the platform.
- **Posit Cloud**: The workspace will be available until Feb 22, otherwise, you could use the free version of PositCloud [https://posit.cloud/](https://posit.cloud/) to work with R in general (but does not have enough computing capacity to work with the data we used in our workshop). Alternatively, you could R/RStudio on your local machine or potentially on your institutional server.
- **spatialGE**: You can continue using the link [https://spatialge.moffitt.org/](https://spatialge.moffitt.org/) and can also use the R package: [https://github.com/FridleyLab/spatialGE](https://github.com/FridleyLab/spatialGE)
