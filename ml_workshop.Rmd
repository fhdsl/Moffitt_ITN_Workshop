## Workshop Material

In this workshop we will cover:

- Fundamentals about machine learning
- Common machine learning modeling methods including:
  - logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest
- Applications for machine learning in cancer research
- Methods for evaluating model performance
- Concepts in tuning models for better performance

We will work through some of the methods from this [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-024-00772-7).
