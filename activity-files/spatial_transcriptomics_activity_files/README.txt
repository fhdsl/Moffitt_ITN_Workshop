DESCRIPTION:
These samples result from tumor biopsies collected from a patient cohort with clear cell 
renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The researchers profiled the samples with 10X Visium to study 
the gene expression in TLS in a spatial context. 

The data set presented here is a subset of the original cohort. Two samples have been 
selected for this example:


- sample_b_01 (TLS positive)
- sample_b_18 (TLS positive)

Two additional samples have been included for workshop attendees to further explore spatialGE
after the workshop:
- sample_a_01 (TLS negative)
- sample_b_07 (TLS negative)
